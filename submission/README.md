## Description

This is the submission file README for Project 1, Part 3 which outlines the repository of database and code that is the collaboration between Cris Benge and Chisom Amalunweze for the Fall 2021 course of *Introduction to Databases* (COMS W4111, section V03 (CVN)).  Part 3 of the project is focused on designing a [very] basic UI in Python 3.x to interact with the tables, execute a variety of SQL queries, etc.  All of the requirements are outlined fully in [the online rubric for this assignment](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~biliris/4111/21f/projects/proj1-3/proj1-3.html).

## Submission Information

Below are the details requested in the submission guidelines for Project 1, Part 3.  Please see the README within the zipped submission file for more details.

| Submission Item | Details |
|:----------------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL account | cb3704 |
| Application URL | http://localhost:8111/ |
| Implementation description | Our application incorporates navigation of all key areas of our database, including logging in as an <b>Administrator</b> and reviewing and approving experiments, logging in as an <b>Inspector</b> and inspecting labs, as well as logging in as a <b>Facilitator</b> to review inspection details and investigate a reported incident.  Simple table views are provided to show the transational data for each of the key tables in our solution.  Please see the UML Activity Case Diagram in the repo README for details of actors and actions within our application.  |
| Two areas of interest | There are several areas of interest throughout our application, but two interesting items in our application is the (1) ability to create and report a new incident (such as a theft or spill of a select agent in a lab), and (2) the ability to both view and update the progress of your experiments on the same form.  These two actions constitute major parts of the actions taken by the key actor in our application, aka. the Researcher.  Please see the UML Activity Case Diagram in the repo README for details of actors and actions within our application. |
